### Roman Urdu:

- "This" keyword hr scope me automatically initialize hojata hai.
- "This" ek object hota hai jo current execution ka context ya usse related information rkhta hai, eg: us scope me variables or methods.
- Regular function k andr "this" ki value dynamic hoti hai, jahan bhi function use hota, "this" us execution k scope ko refer krraha hoga.
- Agr Regular function globally call hoga to us function k andr "this" global window object ko refer krrha hoga.
- Agr Regular function kisi object k andr method me call hoga to us object ko refer krrha hoga.
- Agr Regular function as a Constructor function use horaha ho "new" keyword se to wo ek new object create krega or us empty object ko refer krega, or ye object us function ko refer krrha hoga jo as a constructor initiate hua ho.   
- Agr kisi element pr attached event listener k callback mein this keyword use ho to "this" us element ko refer krrha hoga.
- .call() aapko ek specified "this" value k sath or individual arguments k sath function ko invoke krne me madad karta hai.
- .apply() .call() k similar hai, lekin ye arguments ko ek array k tor pr accept krta hai.
- .bind() ek naya function create krta hai jise specified "this" value k sath or aap us function ko baad me istemal k liye store kr skte hain.
- Arrow functions apne apne "this" context ko nahi rakhte; balke, wo isse enclosing (surrounding) scope se inherit krte hain.
- Asynchronous functions me (jese k setTimeout k callbacks), "this" ka behavior unexpected ho sakta hai function k execute hone k context ki wja se. Is tarah k cases me, arrow functions ka istemal ya "this" ko explicit taur par bind krna expected context ko maintain rkhhne k liye use kiya jaskta hai.


### English

- The "this" keyword is automatically initialized in every scope.
- "This" is an object that holds information related to the current execution context, such as variables or methods in that scope.
- In regular functions, the value of "this" is dynamic, and it refers to the execution scope wherever the function is used.
- If a regular function is globally called, the "this" inside that function refers to the global window object.
- If a regular function is called as a method inside an object, "this" refers to that object.
- If a regular function is used as a constructor function with the "new" keyword, it creates a new object and refers to that empty object. This object will reference the function that was initiated as a constructor.
- If "this" is used inside the callback of an event listener which is attached to an element, "this" will refer to that element.
- The value of "this" can be explicitly set using methods like .call(), .apply(), and .bind().
- .call() allows you to invoke a function with a specified "this" value and individual arguments.
- .apply() is similar to .call(), but it accepts arguments as an array.
- .bind() creates a new function with a specified "this" value and allows you to store that function for later use.
- Arrow functions do not have their own "this" context; they inherit it from the enclosing (surrounding) scope.
- In asynchronous functions (e.g., callbacks in setTimeout), "this" might behave unexpectedly due to the context in which the function is executed. In such cases, using arrow functions or binding "this" explicitly can help maintain the expected context.
